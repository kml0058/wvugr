We are going to make sure the user that is signed in directly related to the comments. The requirement is as follows:

“As a user, I want to see my comments with my username attached so that I and others can know that the comment posted was mine.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are going to test this by:
-logging into a non-admin account made from previous tests
-confirm that user can post a comment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I logged in under the following credentials:
Username: milestone5
Password: Cs230milestone5!

I then went on to check:
-non logged in users can see the comment

As a non admin user, I was unable to see the comment as it was under moderator review.

After looking at the comments, I concluded that the integration test requirements were met, but changes should be made in how comments are seen. 
In the future, the comment should not need to be accepted before being able to be seen.

Therefore, the website passes this integration test.
